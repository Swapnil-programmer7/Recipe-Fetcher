# Recipe-Fetcher
### Welcome to Recipe Fetcher.
This is an application of semantic web🕸️ technology👨‍💻. 
The aim is to use a vast interconnected database (Wikidata) and suggest recipes 🧑‍🍳 to the user.
The suggestions are based on the user requirements of ingredients🗒️, this is an excellent website to have when you have a few ingredients available🥕, but are not sure if a recipe exists🤔 that uses these ingredients💡. The website requires you to list📝 the components you want to include👍 and those that are a no-go🙅. The database is scanned😸 and all the recipes that satisfy the conditions are displayed☮️
